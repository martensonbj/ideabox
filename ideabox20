# Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[Filter Functionality](https://github.com/martensonbj/ideabox/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/search.js#L1-L19)
This was a really satisfying piece of functionality to complete. It helped me get a better understanding of how to manipulate jQuery objects and I was able to apply what I learned to other parts of the app.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[Quality Change](https://github.com/martensonbj/ideabox/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/increase_quality.js#L1-L7)
  I'm trying to make an effort to avoid if-else statements. This was a particularly challenging piece of the project and I would benefit from spending more time refactoring how this is implemented.

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

`$ rspec
............
Finished in 14.19 seconds (files took 3.27 seconds to load)

### Provide a link to an example, if you have one, of a test that covers an 'edge case' or 'unhappy path'
[Model Validations](https://github.com/martensonbj/ideabox/blob/master/spec/models/idea_spec.rb#L15-L25)
An idea isn't very useful without a title and a description. This test makes sure ideas aren't created without those attributes.
